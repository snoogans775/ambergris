A Node.js powered dashboard for Covid-19 Data Analysis

This Covid-19 dashboard is intended to visualize data concerning the
2020 Covid-19 epidemic. The Covid-19 Tracking Project API is cached at regular
intervals for international data.

## Dependencies
- Node.js (v10+)
- NeDB or MongoDB
- ECMAScript 6+
## Installation
- Running the server  -
Run `node main.js` from the root directory.
`nodemon` is installed for dynamic updates.

- Running the web app -
The default port is localhost:3001
All public facing JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files are in /public.

## Notes
- Vanilla JS -
The GUI is built on vanilla JavaScript with ES6 syntax. This was intended to build a f
lexible object-like system in a server-less architecture. A React / Redux version of 
this app will be built soon.
